# RecyclerViewExample

Use Picasso library to download images.

Download Link:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/squareup/picasso/picasso/2.5.2/picasso-2.5.2.jar

Use android.support.widget.RecyclerView instead of GridView.

Use android.support.v7.widget.CardView as single item view, due to some complecations I add the library as a package in my project.

ToDo:

1 handle no connection and timeout exceptions

2 on single item clicked action on RecyclerView

3 splash screen
